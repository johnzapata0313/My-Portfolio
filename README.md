This portfolio website showcases my work as a software engineer, highlighting the projects, skills, and experience that define my development journey. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a clean, responsive layout designed to present my background, recent projects, and contact information in a visually engaging way. The goal of this site is to provide a professional online presence that reflects my growth, creativity, and technical abilities as I continue building and contributing to modern web applications.
